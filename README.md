# Loan_defaulter_analysis

The goal of this project is to perform a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a loan default dataset. The dataset contains information about loan applicants and whether they defaulted on their loans. The purpose of the EDA is to gain insights and uncover patterns in the data to better understand the factors that contribute to loan default.

The project uses various data visualization techniques to explore relationships between various variables and the target variable (loan default). The project also performs feature engineering to create new variables and perform statistical tests to determine the significance of these variables in predicting loan default.

The results of the EDA will provide valuable information for financial institutions when making lending decisions and identifying risk factors for loan default. Additionally, the project can also be used as a reference for individuals looking to understand the loan default process and the factors that contribute to it.

The project uses the Python programming language and several libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to perform the analysis and create visualizations.
